% Estimate the mean of WGN using LMS filter and RLS filter. The two filters
% can be considered as stochastic version of gradien descent and Gauss
% method, respectively.
% 
% The mean of WGN is assumed to be deterministic and hence this is classic
% estimation.
% 
% As expected, RLS filter converges much faster than LMS filter at expense
% of high computation complexity.
