%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% A block of data samples can be obtained by multiplying the infinite long
% input discrete signal by a rectangular window function, corresponding to
% convoluting the Fourier transform of input siganl with a sinc function,
% which causes a "blurred" DTFT and the so-called "spectral leakage". 
% 
% Due to the convolution, a Dirac delta in DTFT will be broadened into the
% frequency response of the window function and therefore the energy of
% single frequency component leaks into other frequencies. 
%
% DFT is a sampled version of the blurred version of DTFT. A longer time
% window will produce a less blurred DTFT and therefore increase the DFT
% sampling resolution. For a given time window, zero-padding the time
% sequence will produce more details of the blurred DTFT, but will not
% increase the effective frequency resolution. Therefore, zero-padding is
% equivalent to oversampling a given DTFT but can not make the DTFT less
% blurred.
