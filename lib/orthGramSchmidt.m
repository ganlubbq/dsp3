function [U] = orthGramSchmidt(V)
%ORTHGRAMSCHMITDT implements the stabilized Gramâ€“Schmidt orthonormalization. The
%columns of matrix V are replaced by orthonormal vectors (columns of U)
%which span the same subspace.
%
% Classic Gram-Schmidt process:
% uk = vk - proj_of_vk_on_u1 - proj_of_vk_on_u2 - ... -
% proj_of_vk_on_u(k-1)
%
% Modified (stablized) Gram-Schmidt process computes each perpendicular
% component iteratively so that each perpendicular component is orthogonal
% to any error introduced in each step:
% 1st: uk = vk - proj_of_vk_on_u1;
% 2nd: uk = uk - proj_of_uk_on_u2;
% ....
%
% Example:
%   Input V = [1 1; 0 1] representing a linear transformation of sheering y
%   axis and U = orthGramSchmidt(V) outputs orthonormal basis U = [1 0; 0 1]
%
% Note that the Gram-Schmitdt process always takes the 1st column of input
% as a start point to construct an orthonormal basis such that it could
% result in an rotated orthonormal basis

    for j = 1:i-1
        U(:,i) = U(:,i) - (U(:,i)' * U(:,j)) * U(:,j);

    U(:,i) = U(:,i) / sqrt(U(:,i)' * U(:,i));
