%MLSE Maximum-Likelihood Sequence Estimation
%   The Viterbi algorithm provides a method for searching through the trellis
%   for the ML signal path. To accomplish this search, the equivalent channel
%   filter coefficients {x_n} must be known or measured by some method. At
%   each stage of the trellis search, there are M^L surviving sequences with
%   M^L corresponding Euclidean distance path metrics.
