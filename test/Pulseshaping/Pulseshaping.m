% The raised cosine pulse-shaping filters in the frequency and time domain
% are compared. In both cases, the type of upsampling symbol sequence
% should be zero inserting. It is shown that the pulse-shaping filter with
% unit energy (integral of instantaneous power) preserves the absolute
% power of signal, i.e., the power of information. The RC filter with small
% roll-off factor has large PAPR such that downsampling the signal to 1 sps
% with different offset will result in the same power. On the other hand,
% the RC filter with large roll-off has small PAPR such that the power of
% downsampled signal will be maximized at the optimal sampling instances.
% All results apply to RRC filter as well.

% By the definition, the energy of discrete signal is approximation of
% energy of its continuous version, i.e, replacing the integral of power
% with summation.

% The energy of symbol sequence goes smaller and smaller as the sampling
% speed increases. It can be understood as more and more "emptiness" is
% discovered with increasing sampling speed.

% Imaging that somehow we are able to sample the symbol sequence at the
% same speed as its repetition without aliasing, and incredibly we're
% sampling at the correct instance, we have no choice but to believe that
% the signal being sampled evolves slowly and smoothly. However, as the
% sampling speed goes faster, we start to realize that the signal being
% sampled is nothing but only a constant power occuring in a very short
% period of time, i.e., the sampling interval. Therefore, a smaller signal
% energy is concluded.

% Luckily, the zero-padded symbol sequence is extremely non-practical in
% the real world as it has infinite bandwidth and there is no way to sample
% it properly. Signals in the real world are inevitably band-limited and
% therefore exhibit smoothness in time domain to some extent. Hence, a
% smaller sampling interval will give a better approximation of energy.
