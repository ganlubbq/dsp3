% The raised cosine pulse-shaping filters in the frequency and time domain
% are compared. In both cases, the type of upsampling symbol sequence
% should be zero inserting. It is shown that the pulse-shaping filter with
% unit energy (integral of instantaneous power) preserves the absolute
% power of signal, i.e., the power of information. The RC filter with small
% roll-off factor has large PAPR such that downsampling the signal to 1 sps
% with different offset will result in the same power. On the other hand,
% the RC filter with large roll-off has small PAPR such that the power of
% downsampled signal will be maximized at the optimal sampling instances.
% All results apply to RRC filter as well.
