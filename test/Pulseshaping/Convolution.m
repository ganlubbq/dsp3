% TEST SCRIPT FOR EVALUATING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LINEAR CONVOLUTION BY
% USING FFT-BASED CIRCULAR CONVOLUTION. 
%
% Assuming that the length of filter l is always less than the length of
% data p, then padding both the filter coeff and data to l + p - 1 and do
% fft-based circular convolution would generate identical output with
% linear convolution for full length l + p - 1

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Basic setting
% filter has length P < L
P = 6;
h = (1 : P) ./ P;

% data has length L
L = 11;
x = randi([0 1], 1, L);

% canonical conv output has length L+P-1
y = conv(x, h);

% circular conv will be identical to linear conv provided N >= L+P-1
N = L + P - 1;

% implement linear conv using N-point DFT (circular) and zero padding
yc_N = ifft(fft([x, zeros(1, N-L)]) .* fft([h, zeros(1, N-P)]));

% part of circular conv is identical to linear conv, if P < L, when using
% L-point DFT -- the first P-1 points of circular conv will be different
yc_L = ifft(fft(x) .* fft([h, zeros(1, L-P)]));
