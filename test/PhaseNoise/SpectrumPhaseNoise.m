% sinusoid phase noise: the power of carrier is distributed to spikes at
% side-band, spacing as the frequency of phase noise and decaying as the
% increasing order of Bessel function of the first kind at the amplitude of
% phase noise

% the amplitude of the first spike aside the carrier is roughly half of the
% amplitude of sinusoid phase noise (dBc, with respect to the carrier), and
% all the other higher order spikes are negligible when the phase noise is
% small. In PSD, the 1st spike should be 2 * dbw(an / 2) lower than the
% carrier.
