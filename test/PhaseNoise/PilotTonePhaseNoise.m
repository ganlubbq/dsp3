% pilot-tone in the filtering zone by shifting even more energy to the zero

% now the noise peak at zero frequency is hidden in the peak of pilot-tone
% and therefore is not observable. However, by plotting the signal in time
% domain, we can observe that everything including the noise is reduced to
% one dimension, while the seperated WGN remains two dimension after phase
% recovery.

% interestingly, the (phase) noise power remains in the pilot is nonzero
% after phase recovery, the power of seperated WGN remains the same,
% however the combined noise power in the filtering zone is reduced after
% phase recovery, indicating that although the phase recovery is a linear
% process to the data mode (d * exp(ip) + w), the residual noise in the data
% and WGN part is correlated.

% so, if thers is another signal aside the pilot-tone waiting for the phase
% noise compensation, it's better not to be too close to the pilot-tone
% otherwise part of the singal will be reduced to one dimension as well.
% Although one can observe a noise power reduction in the signal......
